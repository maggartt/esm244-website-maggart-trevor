## Ball is life

Basketball is constantly evolving. Where the big man once dominated the post, today the game is dominated by efficient 3-point shooting. Yet still, players like Giannis Antentokounmpo show the game can still be changed. 

Below I use **hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC)** to find similarities across NBA teams, as well as the top 30 players based on minutes played per game. To determine these clusters, I use the following *per game* parameters: `age`, field goals made (`fg`), field goals attempted (`fga`), three-pointers made (`x3p`), three-pointers attempted (`x3pa`), two-pointers made (`x2p`), two-pointers attempted (`x2pa`), free throws made (`ft`), free throws attempted (`fta`), offensive rebounds (`orb`), defensive rebounds (`drb`), assists (`ast`), steals (`stl`), blocks (`blk`), turnovers (`trv`), personal fouls (`pf`), and points (`pts`).

The data was downloaded from Kaggle and scraped by user Vivo Vinco from Basketball Reference (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_per_game.html). 

```{r data team}
# Read in the 'water chemistry' data
nba_teams <- read_csv(here('nba.csv')) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% # convert to lowercase 
  select(-rk,-player,-g,-gs,-mp,-pos,-fg_percent,-x3p_percent,-x2p_percent,-ft_percent,-e_fg_percent,-trb) %>%
  na_if(-999)

# Create a summary dataframe
nba_teams_sum <- nba_teams %>% 
  group_by(tm) %>% 
  summarize(age_mean = mean(age, na.rm = T),
            fg_mean = mean(fg, na.rm = T),
            fga_mean = mean(fga, na.rm = T),
            x3p_mean = mean(x3p, na.rm = T),
            x3pa_mean = mean(x3pa, na.rm = T),
            x2p_mean = mean(x2p, na.rm = T),
            x2pa_mean = mean(x2pa, na.rm = T),
            orb_mean = mean(orb, na.rm = T),
            ft_mean = mean(ft, na.rm = T),
            fta_mean = mean(fta, na.rm = T),
            drb_mean = mean(drb, na.rm = T),
            ast_mean = mean(ast, na.rm = T),
            stl_mean = mean(stl, na.rm = T),
            blk_mean = mean(blk, na.rm = T),
            tov_mean = mean(tov, na.rm = T),
            pf_mean = mean(pf, na.rm = T),
            pts_mean = mean(pts, na.rm = T)) 

nba_teams_scale <- nba_teams_sum %>% 
  select(-tm) %>% 
  scale()

rownames(nba_teams_scale) <- nba_teams_sum$tm
```

## Team Analysis {.tabset .tabset-fade}

The following analysis will use **hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC)** to determine clusters for teams in the NBA. Clustering will be based on **euclidean distance** measurements. Both a complete linkage and single linkage dendrogram will be presented, as well as a subsequent tanglegram to compare the two. 

### Complete Linkage Dendrogram
```{r}
# Calculating the Euclidian matrix
nba_teams_dist <- dist(nba_teams_scale, method = 'euclidean') 

# Hierarchical clustering (complete linkage)
nba_teams_hc_complete <- hclust(nba_teams_dist, method = "complete")

# converting to a dendrogram
nba_teams_hc_complete %>% 
  as.dendrogram() -> nba_teams_hc_dend_complete # Store as dendrogram

# Visualizing the complete linkage dendrogram
nba_teams_hc_dend_complete %>%  
  set("labels_col", value = c("#3d85c6", "#29be8a", "#e5e544","#ff8400"), k=4) %>%
  set("branches_k_color", value = c("#3d85c6", "#29be8a", "#e5e544","#ff8400"), k = 4) %>%
  set("branches_lwd", 3) %>% 
  plot(horiz=FALSE, axes=TRUE)
abline(v = 350, lty = 5)
```

### Single Linkage Dendrogram
```{r}
# Hierarchical clustering (single linkage)
nba_teams_hc_single <- hclust(nba_teams_dist, method = "single" )

# converting to a dendrogram
nba_teams_hc_single %>%

```

### Analysis

The **hierarchical agglomerative clustering** produced some interesting observations. Given the complexity of finding similarities between diverse teams, it is hard to glean clear findings from the team analysis. In contrast, there are much clearer clusters in the player analysis. 

Looking at the players by points we see interesting results. Grouped together we see athletic big men like Joel Embiid and Giannis Antentokounmpo, 25 year old shooting guards Devin Booker and Jaylen Brown, high scoring veteran players DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Durant, and all around young guys Luka Doncic and Trae Young. In the latter example, we can see they have similar ages (22 and 23), shooting percentages, assists (9.4 and 8.9), and more.

At higher distances (~6) we can see larger trends such as high rebound players (cluster includes Joel Embiid, Giannis Antentokounmpo, Nikoa Jokic, etc.). Further research could include additional data on physical characteristics of players: height, wingspan, vertical jump height, etc.
